# WELCOME TO THE THREE ASSIGMENT IN OOP 2021

> What Is It About?

In this assigment we used python for the first time!

We created classes that represent directed weighted graph.


> Main Uses

* Simple operations on the graph such as:
1. Adding and removing vertices.
2. Adding and removing edges.
3. Getting number of edges, vertices and changes made in the graph.

**for more information check out part one in the wiki pages**

* More complicated operations on the graph such as:
1. Getting the shortest path between two vertices and the distance between them, using the Dijkstra algorithm.
2. Getting the SCC in the graph and a specific vertex' SCC, using the Tarjan algorithm.
3. Saving the graph to a json format and loding a graph from a json format.
4. Drawing the graph.

> Compared To Other:

In this project we compared our work at Java (assigment two in this course) and the standard library in python- networkx.

Here are the results:
